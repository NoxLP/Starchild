# Starchild
Starchild is a responsive web app, which shows astronomic events in multiple ways, including information about moon phases, weather, and several ways of viewing and filtering the events.

A REST API is exposed in the back-end using expressJS, which manages the front-end requests
to retrieve the data from a non relational Mongo Atlas database, which uses mongoose to map the data.
Multiple APIs are planned to be used for data gathering.

The front-end is mainly done in Vuetify, with axios to send requests to the back-end.

In its whole, it is a mélange of JavaScript ES6 and HTML5, among other npm utilities such as: bcrypt, cors, helmet, dotenv, jsonwebtoken and morgan.

The app is currently a work in progress and it is planned to be deployed on Netlify.

The developing team consists on three students from [Reboot Academy](https://www.reboot.academy/): 
- [Jonatan Santana González](https://github.com/jonatansg)
- [Norberto Sáez Perdomo](https://github.com/NoxLP)
- [Romina Elorrieta](https://github.com/RoElorrieta)

Please, remember that, as of today (2021/02/26), the app is still a work in progress. Specifications below are subject to change.

## API endpoints (@ 26/02/2021)
